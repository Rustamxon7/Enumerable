# Enumerable

The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method #each, which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.
